## Padel Service API

This is a backend API for managing **padel games**, **customers**, and **payments**. The service handles operations such as managing customer data, tracking game details, and processing payments. It connects to a **PostgreSQL** database and provides a RESTful interface for interacting with the data.

### Features:

- **Customer Management**: Create, read, and update customer information.
- **Game Management**: Track game schedules, participants, and fields.
- **Payment Management**: Manage payment records associated with customers and games.

The project is structured to be modular and easy to extend. It follows standard best practices for organizing Node.js applications into separate directories for controllers, models, routes, services, and utilities.

### Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**: Backend server
- **Express**: Web framework for handling routes and requests
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing customer, game, and payment data
- **Sequelize** (Optional): ORM for interacting with PostgreSQL (if used)
- **Joi/Validator.js** (Optional): Validation library for ensuring data integrity

### Folder Breakdown:

- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files for the application, including database connection settings.
- **`controllers/`**: Holds the controller files that manage route logic. Each controller corresponds to a specific domain, such as `customer`, `game`, and `payment`.
- **`models/`**: Contains the entity definitions for the application, which may include database schemas if using an ORM (e.g., Sequelize).
- **`routes/`**: Defines the API endpoints for the application. Each route file manages a specific resource, such as customer, game, or payment.
- **`services/`**: Includes the core business logic for interacting with the database. Services contain functions that process data and handle operations.
- **`utils/`**: Contains helper functions, such as data validation logic.
- **`node_modules/`**: Directory created by npm to store the dependencies for the application.
- **`package.json`**: The npm configuration file for managing dependencies and running scripts.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Ensures that the exact same versions of dependencies are installed across environments.
- **`server.js`**: The main entry point for the application, where the server is initialized and routes are registered.
